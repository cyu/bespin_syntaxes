== Syntax Highlight Plugins for Bespin

This project contains Syntax Highlight Plugins for Bespin.  These plugins were generated from TextMate syntax files, and requires a custom syntax engine that is also a part of this project.

This project is currently in active development.  I've only tested this on a small number of files, and the performance isn't as great as I would like, but it's a good start.
